## ðŸ§  How It Works
   - Launches a headless Brave browser
   - Navigates to the Flipkart product review page
   - Scrolls (optional) and waits for reviews to load
   - Extracts:
     -- Customer name
     -- Review title
     -- Star rating
   - Comment (with READ MORE removed)
   - Repeats until no "Next" button found
   - Saves to flipkart_reviews_optimized.csv

---

## ðŸ§ª Usage

In the script, update this line with your Flipkart product review URL:

```python
url = "https://www.flipkart.com/your-product-link-product-reviews/itmxxxxxxxxxxxx?pid=PIDXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
Then run the script:
You don't need the full link, just paste the link till pid

Output:
  - flipkart_reviews.csv
  - Console log shows scrape progress and time taken
  - The CSV file contains the extracted reviews along with Customer Name, Review Title, Rating, and Review Comment. It is generated upon completion of scraping all pages.
